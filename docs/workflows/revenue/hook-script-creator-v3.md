## STEP 1: GATHER INPUTS

Before generating anything, ask the user these questions ONE AT A TIME:

1. **Product/Service:** What are you selling? (name, type, offer)
2. **Target Audience:** Who is the ideal buyer? (be specific: profession, income level, lifestyle, qualifying traits)
3. **Main Pain Point:** What problem does the target struggle with?
4. **Solution/Offer:** How does your product solve it? What's the transformation?
5. **Price Point / Investment Level:** What does it cost? (used to calibrate qualifying language in hooks)
6. **Language:** What language should the hooks and scripts be written in? (English, Spanish, other)

Once all 6 answers are collected, proceed to generation.

## UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES (Apply to HOOKS and BODIES)

These two principles govern everything you write — hooks, bodies, and CTAs. They are not specific to one section; they shape how you think about every line of copy.

### Principle A — Dimensionalize every benefit

Never state a benefit in the abstract. Always translate it into the real-life impact on the viewer's daily life.

- In a **hook** (3-5 sec): one quick dimensionalization. "1.500 € al mes" instead of "15% annual return". "Una villa con piscina" instead of "a high-yield asset". The hook has time for one concrete image, not a full explanation.
- In the **body** (30-45 sec): full dimensionalization. Show what the benefit means for their morning, their month, their year. "1.500 € landing in your account every month while you sleep — that's your car payment, your kid's school, or your next trip, covered."

The test: for every benefit you write, ask "And what does that actually mean for their life?" Then write THAT. The viewer doesn't care about the benefit itself — they care about how the benefit changes their Tuesday morning.

### Principle B — Anticipate objections before they form

The viewer's brain is already building reasons NOT to act. Your copy must neutralize the top objections BEFORE the viewer consciously formulates them. If you address an objection after they've already thought it, you're defending. If you address it before, you're leading.

- In a **hook** (3-5 sec): kill one objection with a short phrase woven into the hook. "Sin gestionar nada" kills "I don't have time." "Se entrega en menos de un mes" kills "I'd have to wait forever." One objection max — the hook is too short for more.
- In the **body** (30-45 sec): neutralize 2-3 objections woven naturally into the Solution section. Don't create a separate "but wait" block — that feels defensive. Instead, embed objection-killers as features of the solution: "With a Spanish team on the ground" (kills trust objection), "fully furnished and managed" (kills hassle objection), "already generating income" (kills risk objection).

The test: list the top 3 reasons your target would say "not for me." Then check if your hook kills at least 1 and your body kills at least 2. If not, rewrite.

## STEP 2: GENERATE 10+ HOOK VARIATIONS

### Hook Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

**The hook is EVERYTHING. 80% of people won't watch past 3 seconds. The hook makes or breaks the ad.**

1. **Call out the target SPECIFICALLY** — Qualify them by identity, income, behavior, or investment level so only the RIGHT people stop scrolling. The hook should repel the wrong audience and magnetically attract the right one.
2. **Expose the contradiction** — Show the gap between what they've achieved in one area of life and what they're failing at in the area you solve. This creates cognitive dissonance that demands resolution.
3. **Use simple language** — Write at a 5th-7th grade reading level. Short sentences. No jargon. No sophisticated words. If you'd say it at a cocktail party to a friend, it's the right tone.
4. **Pattern interrupt** — The hook must break the scroll pattern. Bold statements, provocative questions, unexpected contrasts, or calling out a specific behavior.
5. **Sell the NEXT STEP, not the product** — The hook's job is to earn the next 5 seconds of attention. Nothing more.
6. **One idea per hook** — Never cram multiple concepts. One big idea. One sharp angle.
7. **Anchor the hook — no ambiguity** — Every hook must include at least ONE concrete anchor that instantly tells the viewer what this is about and who it's for. The anchor eliminates ambiguity so the right person stops scrolling and the wrong person keeps going. It can be: (a) a location or product identifier (e.g. "Bali", "villa with pool"), (b) an explicit target callout (e.g. "real estate agents", "SaaS founders"), or (c) niche-specific language that only the right audience would recognize (e.g. "exclusive listings", "MRR", "close more deals"). The test: if someone outside your target audience reads the hook and thinks "this could be for me," the anchor is too weak. One anchor minimum per hook. No generic hooks that could apply to anything.
8. **Qualify or price — always one** — Every hook must include EITHER the specific price/investment level OR a qualifying callout that filters the audience by income, behavior, or status. The purpose is to act as a gate: only people who can realistically afford the offer should feel spoken to. If the offer has a set price, state it. If there's no fixed price, use language that signals the level — job title, revenue range, lifestyle markers, or behavior patterns that correlate with ability to pay. A hook without a filter attracts everyone and converts no one. Examples: "127.000 €" (price filter), "founders doing 7 figures" (status filter), "men who invest in business coaches" (behavior filter).
9. **Precision filters — no rounding down** — When using price or qualifying language, match the REAL barrier to entry exactly. Never soften, round down, or widen the filter to seem more accessible — this attracts leads who can't afford the offer and wastes every euro downstream (ad spend, sales calls, follow-ups). If it costs 127.000 €, say 127.000 € — not "more than 100K". If it costs 2.000 €, don't target "anyone interested in self-improvement" — target people whose profile clearly supports that spend. The hook is the first filter in the funnel. If it's loose, you pay for unqualified leads at every stage. Every number and qualifier must match the actual investment required. This applies to any offer at any price point: a €50 product, a €2.000 mentorship, or a €127.000 investment. The principle is the same — precision in, precision out.
10. **Sales-ready leads, not just clicks** — Every hook must attract leads that are easy to close, not just easy to attract. Before writing a hook, ask: who ends up on the sales call? If the hook attracts people who need to be educated on the concept, convinced that the category exists, or who can't realistically afford the offer, it's the wrong hook. Target people who are already predisposed to buy — they just need the right opportunity. A hook that generates 100 cheap leads that don't close is worse than a hook that generates 10 expensive leads that do. The hook is the first step of the sales process, not just a marketing metric. Write hooks that make the closer's job easier, not harder.
11. **Say it out loud** — Every hook must sound natural when spoken aloud. If it sounds like someone reading a script, rewrite it. If it sounds like a list of features stitched together, rewrite it. The test: record yourself saying it. If you stumble, pause, or it feels robotic, it's not ready. Hooks are written for voice — video ads, voiceovers, reels — not for print. Write like someone talks, not like someone writes. Contractions, natural pauses, and conversational rhythm are all good. Stiff, formal, or overly constructed sentences are not.
12. **No Frankenstein closings** — The hook must end as a complete thought. Never bolt the product/price onto the end of an unrelated sentence like an afterthought. If the closing feels "glued on" — like "Uluwatu, desde 127.000 €" dropped after a sentence about something else — rewrite the ending so it flows naturally. The product mention should feel like the logical conclusion of the idea, not a tagline stapled to the end. Test: cover the last sentence of the hook. Does the hook still make sense without it? If yes, the closing is disconnected and needs to be integrated into the idea, not appended to it.

### Hook Formulas to Use:

**CATEGORY A — CONTRAST & COMPARISON (show the gap between current state and desired state)**
- **A/B Price Contrast:** "Con [amount] en [current bad option] consigues [bad result]. Con lo mismo en [your solution] consigues [great result]."
- **Investment Contrast:** "You'll spend $[amount] on [other thing] but won't fix [your area]."
- **Worse Alternative Compare:** "Still using [worse alternative]? Here's why [your solution] is [specific advantage]."
- **Time/Money Tradeoff:** "[Amount] in [bad option] gives you [low return]. [Amount] in [your solution] gives you [high return]. Do the math."

**CATEGORY B — LOSS AVERSION & FEAR (make them feel the cost of inaction)**
- **Worst Error:** "The worst mistake you can make with [amount/situation] in [year] is [what they're currently doing]."
- **Uncomfortable Question:** "If you have [amount/situation], how much has it generated/improved in the last year? Because [your solution] is generating [specific result]."
- **Hidden Cost of Inaction:** "Every month your [resource] sits in [current state], you're losing [specific amount]. Here's the math."
- **Regret Frame:** "A year from now, you'll wish you had [taken action]. Here's why."

**CATEGORY C — AUTHORITY & SOCIAL PROOF (build credibility fast)**
- **Track Record Stack:** "In [timeframe] we've [delivered X]. [Number] projects. [Number] results. Now you can [specific offer]."
- **Data Authority Avalanche:** "Why [action]? [Stat 1]. [Stat 2]. [Stat 3]. [Stat 4]. And you can [specific offer + price]."

**CATEGORY D — URGENCY & SCARCITY (create real time pressure)**
- **Rare Window:** "This almost never happens: [specific product] still at [pre-construction/early] price, but delivered in [short timeframe]."
- **Countdown:** "We have [number] left. At [price]. When they're gone, this price doesn't exist anymore."
- **Time Savings:** "Normally [process] takes [long time]. Not this one. [Short time] and you're in."

**CATEGORY E — DIRECT CALLOUT & QUALIFICATION (filter the right audience)**
- **Qualify + Contradiction:** "[Target with status/investment], why are you still [failing at X]?"
- **If/Then Expose:** "If you can afford [thing they invest in] but not [your solution area], that's the problem."
- **Status + Pain:** "You built [impressive achievement]. So why does [problem] still [emotional impact]?"
- **Smart Investor Frame:** "If an investor with [amount] could choose between [bad option at low return] or [your solution at high return], what would they choose?"
- **Direct Callout:** "[Specific target], if you want [desired outcome] with [specific advantage], this is for you."

**CATEGORY F — QUESTION HOOKS (force them to engage mentally)**
- **Yes-Only Question:** "Would you [take action] if [objection removed] and [second objection removed]? [Specific offer + price]."
- **Challenge Question:** "Serious question: how much has your [resource] generated in the last [timeframe]?"
- **Why Question Opener:** "Why [specific action]? [Then stack reasons/data]."
- **Rhetorical Reversal:** "You know the difference between [people who get result] and [people who don't]? [One specific thing]."

**CATEGORY G — STORYTELLING & NARRATIVE (pull them in with a story arc)**
- **Customer Story:** "[Name] put [amount] into [your solution]. In [timeframe], [specific result]. Today [ongoing benefit]."
- **Founder/Origin Story:** "We're [identity], we live in [location], and we've been [doing thing] for [years]. If you want [result] with [trust element], this is for you."
- **Mistake Confession:** "I made [number] expensive mistakes in [field] so you don't have to. Here's what I learned."
- **Before/After Journey:** "I used to [old bad situation]. Then I discovered [solution]. Now [new great situation]."

**CATEGORY H — BENEFIT-FIRST & OFFER-LED (lead with what they get)**
- **Llave en Mano Stack:** "[Product]: [benefit 1], [benefit 2], [benefit 3], ready in [timeframe]. [Location] from [price]. You just [simple action]."
- **Income Promise:** "If you want to [generate income/achieve goal] starting now, without [objection 1] and without [objection 2], we have [specific offer + price]."
- **Transformation Paint:** "How would your life change if [specific income/result] arrived every [timeframe] without you doing anything?"
- **Simple Math:** "[Amount] → [your solution] → [monthly/annual return]. That's it."

### Hook Examples (STUDY THIS STYLE):

English:
- "You invest in business coaches. Why haven't you invested in becoming the one who chooses the women you want?"
- "Men who spend thousands on their career, why are you still chasing instead of attracting?"
- "You'll drop money on watches, cars, or courses, but still spiral when she doesn't text back."
- "You built a life most men want. So why does one woman still mess with your head?"

Spanish:
- "Agente o agencia inmobiliaria: si ya estas cerrando operaciones cada mes, instala un sistema con IA que te garantice 5 exclusivas mensuales y dispara tus comisiones."
- "Agente o agencia inmobiliaria: si ya facturas mas de 15.000 al mes, este sistema con IA puede llevarte a 5 exclusivas nuevas cada mes y escalar tus ingresos."

**Generate at least 10 hook variations using different formulas and angles.**

## STEP 3: GENERATE 3 UNIVERSAL BODY SCRIPTS (PAS-A)

### CRITICAL: UNIVERSAL BODY DESIGN

**The 3 body scripts must be UNIVERSAL — designed to work with ANY hook from Step 2 plugged in front of them.**

This is NOT optional. The reason:

- **Round 1 of testing = test the HOOK only.** You film 10+ hook takes (3-5 seconds each) and attach them to ONE body script. One variable. Clean data. Meta tells you which hooks stop the scroll.
- **Round 2 of testing = test the BODY.** You take the top 3-5 winning hooks and pair each with all 3 body scripts. Now you're testing which angle converts, using hooks you already know work.
- **Round 3 of testing = test the CREATIVE.** Same winning hook + body, different filming styles (sitting/standing, close-up/wide, outfits, locations).

**Each round builds on proven data from the round before. No budget is wasted on untested combinations.**

### How to Make Body Scripts Universal:

1. **The body must NOT reference the specific hook.** No "like I just said" or "that question I asked." The body starts fresh after the hook cut.
2. **The body's opening line (Problem section) should re-ground the viewer** in the pain point broadly — not repeat the hook but expand on the emotional territory.
3. **Each body takes a DIFFERENT ANGLE on the same core problem.** Different agitate. Different solution framing. Different emotional territory. But all three work regardless of which hook precedes them.
4. **The transition from hook to body should feel natural with ANY hook.** Test this by mentally reading each body after 3-4 different hooks. If it feels jarring with any of them, the body is too hook-specific.

### PAS-A Structure (Applied to Universal Bodies):

#### P — PROBLEM (Bridge + Problem Statement) [0-5 seconds after hook]
- Do NOT repeat the hook — bridge INTO the problem
- Re-establish the pain point from a slightly different angle than the hook
- Make them say: "That's me... that's exactly how I'm feeling right now"
- This section must flow naturally after ANY hook from Step 2

#### A — AGITATE (Twist the Knife) [5-15 seconds]
- Make them FEEL the pain on a deeper level
- Describe the emotional cost of NOT solving this problem
- Use vivid, relatable scenarios they experience daily
- Frame it so it feels like it's NOT their fault — there's a reason they haven't solved it yet
- Agitate with empathy, not with insults

#### S — SOLUTION (Present the New Opportunity) [15-35 seconds]
- Introduce YOUR solution as the bridge from pain to transformation
- Lead with the OUTCOME, not the features
- Use an authority statement: "After working with [number] of [targets]..." or "We've discovered..."
- Present it as a NEW OPPORTUNITY — not "another version" of what they've tried
- Create intellectual property: name your system/method/framework
- Include social proof if available (testimonial, number of clients, results)
- Explain WHY their problem exists in a way that feels like it's not their fault
- Show the differentiator: why YOUR solution vs. the 100 others

#### A — ACTION (CTA) [35-45 seconds]
- Clear, specific call to action
- Sell the CLICK, not the product
- Create urgency or FOMO
- Tell them exactly what happens next: "Click the link below to [specific next step]"
- Remind them: if they don't act, nothing changes

### The 3 Body Angles (Each Must Be Distinct):

**Body A — The Pain Angle:**
Focus on the emotional cost. Agitate the daily frustration. The viewer should feel the weight of NOT solving this. Solution = relief from pain.

**Body B — The Failed Solutions Angle:**
Focus on what they've already tried and why it didn't work. Agitate the frustration of having invested time/money in the wrong things. Solution = the NEW approach that addresses what others missed.

**Body C — The Transformation Angle:**
Focus on what life looks like AFTER. Paint the outcome vividly. Agitate by contrasting where they are now vs where they could be. Solution = the vehicle that gets them there.

### Script Writing Rules:

1. **Write like you talk** — Cocktail party test. If you wouldn't say it to someone face-to-face, don't write it.
2. **5th grade reading level** — Use the Hemingway standard. Simple words. Short sentences. No fluff.
3. **Benefits > Features** — Never say what the product IS. Say what the product DOES for them.
4. **Outcome clarity** — Be crystal clear about the specific result: "double your sales in 30 days" NOT "revolutionize your business"
5. **One big idea per body** — Don't try to cover everything in one script.
6. **Story format when possible** — Humans connect with stories. Founder stories, customer transformation stories, and VSL-style narratives get higher watch times and better engagement.
7. **Performance > Branding** — The goal is CONVERSION, not looking pretty. Scrappy and converting beats polished and ignored.
8. **Universal compatibility** — Each body MUST work with any hook plugged in front of it. This is non-negotiable.

---

## STEP 4: TESTING PLAN

After generating hooks and body scripts, provide a testing plan:

### Round 1 — Test the HOOK (Week 1)
- Film all 10+ hooks as separate 3-5 second takes
- Film Body A once (30-40 seconds)
- Edit: Swap each hook in front of the same Body A
- Result: 10+ ads with one variable (the hook)
- Budget: Small spend across all hooks (~€10-15 per hook)
- Goal: Identify top 3-5 hooks by click-through rate and cost per lead
- Timeline: 5-7 days

### Round 2 — Test the BODY (Week 2-3)
- Take winning 3-5 hooks from Round 1
- Film Body B and Body C
- Edit: Pair each winning hook with all 3 bodies
- Result: 9-15 ads testing hook + body combinations
- Budget: Concentrate spend on proven hooks
- Goal: Identify which body angle converts best (cost per booked call, not just clicks)
- Timeline: 7-10 days

### Round 3 — Test the CREATIVE (Week 4+)
- Take winning hook + body combination
- Re-film with different creative variables:
  - Sitting vs standing
  - Close-up vs half-body
  - Different outfits / locations
  - Different energy levels
- Result: 4-6 creative variations of the same proven script
- Goal: Optimise the visual delivery for maximum performance
- Timeline: Ongoing

### Testing Rules:
- **One variable per round.** Never test hook AND body AND creative simultaneously.
- **Kill fast.** If a hook gets no traction in 48 hours with sufficient impressions, cut it.
- **Scale slow.** Increase budget on winners by max 20% per day to avoid resetting the algorithm.
- **Track to the money.** CTR means nothing if it doesn't lead to booked calls. Always optimise for the deepest funnel metric you have data on.
